# UDAC-FED-Web Programming with JavaScript-Project-Memory Game

## Introduction
This project is being submitted in connection with part 2, "Web Programming with JavaScript," of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.  The [general required functionality](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd001/parts/3d3d1bdc-316b-46c2-bdcf-b713c82804da/modules/677caa06-55d6-444e-a853-08627c5516a7/lessons/4227cbf4-f6ce-4798-a7e5-b1ce3b9e7c33/concepts/0a38769e-8e23-4e3f-9482-d8d1aa80fbb6) for the project was stated as follows:

> ### Game Functionality
> The real-life game, players flip over cards to locate the pairs that match The goal is to recreate this effect in your project. There are a couple of interactions that you'll need to handle:

> * Flipping cards
> * What happens when cards match
> * What happens when cards do not match
> * When the game finishes

In addition to this required functionality, a few things have been added:

* Basing the cards on a simplified model of playing cards (although currently without icons)
* Allowing the user to resume play after winning
* Establishing a maximum total number of clicks that, when exceeded, forces the user to start the game over
